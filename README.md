**Titanic Feature Correlation & DSL-Based Feature Selection**

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using Python and a mini Domain Specific Language (DSL) for automated feature selection. It includes data preprocessing, correlation heatmap visualization, survival rate analysis by passenger class, and saving results for reporting. Runs seamlessly on Google Colab.

**Features**
Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
Correlation heatmap for visualizing feature relationships.
DSL for selecting features based on simple rules (e.g., correlation thresholds).
Visualization of survival rate by passenger class.
Saves analysis results and figures for inclusion in reports.

Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Regex
Google Colab (for quick cloud execution)

**How to Run**
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook (titanic_analysis_colab.ipynb) in Google Colab.
3. Upload train.csv from Kaggle Titanic Dataset.
4. Run cells step-by-step.
5. Download output plots and selected features for reporting.

   
**Outputs**
correlation_heatmap.png – Correlation matrix visualization.
class_distribution.png – Survival rate by passenger class.
selected_features.txt – Features selected via DSL rule.

**Project Highlights**
Demonstrates intuitive data analysis pipeline design.
Shows how a DSL can make code closer to product specification.
Clean, simple, and Colab-ready for students and developers.
